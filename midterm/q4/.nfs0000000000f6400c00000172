\title{Summary of Midterm Question 3}
\author{Jeremy Emmett}
\maketitle
In part (a), IDL calculated the value of the specified function of x by calling on the function f_x to return the value of f(x). 
\par
In part (b), IDL calculated an approximate value for the integral of the function, given arbitary
bounds of integration, using a Simpson's rule function. 
\par
In part (c), IDL calculated and approximate value for the integral of the function, from x=1 to x=10, using the same Simpson's rule function.
\par
In part (d), IDL calculated the analytical value for the integral of the function, from x=1 to x=10, using an analytical integrator function. The Simpson's rule approximation was found to be 0.003 percent smaller than the analytical value for this integration range. 
\par
The computed values were:
(a)      29.0801
(b)      5.05481
(c)      2526.91
(d)      2527.00
\par
In part (e and f), IDL calculated the accuracy error resulting from splitting the integral into different step sizes. There's a coding issue in using the Simpson's rule function to compute an approximate integral for different step sizes, so the resulting accuracy errors are too large.
