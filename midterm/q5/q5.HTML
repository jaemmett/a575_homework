This would be the link to the code. I'm not sure how to make the code available
on a proper web page. 

<H1>Summary</H1>

<P> In part (a), IDL calculated the value of the specified function of x by calling on the function fx to return the value of f(x).

<P> <B>In part (b), IDL calculated an approximate value for the integral of the function, given arbitary
bounds of integration, using a Simpson's rule function. </B>

<P> <B>In part (c), IDL calculated and approximate value for the integral of the function, from x=1 to x=10, using the same Simpson's rule function. </B>

<P> <B>In part (d), IDL calculated the analytical value for the integral of the function, from x=1 to x=10, using an analytical integrator function. The Simpson's rule approximation was found to be 0.003 percent smaller than the analytical value for this integration range. </B>

<P> <B>The computed values were:(a)29.0801, (b)5.05481, (c)2526.91, (d)2527.00</B>

<P> <B>In part (e and f), IDL calculated the accuracy error resulting from splitting the integral into different step sizes. There's a coding issue in using the Simpson's rule function to compute an approximate integral for different step sizes, so the resulting accuracy errors are too large. Because of this issue, I couldn't determine how many pieces are required to get 0.1% accuracy. </B>
